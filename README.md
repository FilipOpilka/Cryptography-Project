This is a comprehensive cryptography-themed application written in Python that consists of three basic components: 
- The first part of the application focuses on classical ciphers, including encrypting and breaking the Caesar cipher, the Vigenère cipher and the Playfair cipher. 
- The second part of the application centers around the RSA asymmetric algorithm, which is commonly used for secure data transmission. 
- The third part of the application is based on the Shamir's secret sharing algorithm, which allows secure sharing of confidential information between multiple parties. In addition, the application has the ability to send ciphertext fragments over a local network, which further enhances its functionality.
